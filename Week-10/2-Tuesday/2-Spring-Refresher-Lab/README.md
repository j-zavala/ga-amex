## Introduction

We've spent a lot of time with React, but now it's time to revisit our good old friends Spring and Spring Boot and bring everything together.

----

## Spring Teach-Backs

To do that, we're going to split into groups. Each group will teach an important Spring concept back to the class to refresh everyone's memories and get us ready for the next lesson.

Form groups of 4â€“5 people. I'll assign each group a topic:

- Spring framework basics
- Spring Boot basics
- Spring data
- Spring Boot security
- Testing in Spring Boot

Take 30 minutes to create a ~5-minute presentation for the class. In your presentation, you should plan to cover:

- What your concept is and how it works.
- Why it's useful for developers.
- Any tips to keep in mind or "gotchas" to look out for.
- An application that uses it (and how it works).
- How it's relevant to React applications.
