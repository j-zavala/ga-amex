      <a href="">In West Philadelphia</a>, born and raised, on the playground is
      where I spent most of my days:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chilling Out</li>
      <li>Maxing</li>
      <li>Relaxing, all cool</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I was shooting ome b-ball outside of the school when a couple of guys –
      they were up to no good – started making trouble in my neighborhood.

    <p>I got in <em>one little fight</em> and my mom got scared. She said,</p>
