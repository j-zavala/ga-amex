## CSS Grid Layout

Emulate the design provided in the [magazine-layout.jpg](./magazine-layout.jpg).

CSS tricks has an excellent [CSS grid reference](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/).

It is your choice to position the grid items using `-start` and `-end`, or build your layout using `grid-template-areas`.

Take advantage of DevTools to inspect your grid and see what is going on under the hood. [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) has some excellent developer tools that visually display grid line numbers
and grid area names.

### Style Guidelines
