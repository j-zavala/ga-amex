## Introduction 

It's time to get your Disney on! While you probably won't be able to create Moana-level animations, you _will_ practice how to make some images move around on the screen. We all start somewhere, right?

Work through the following four exercises and see how much you can get done in the next hour. Each folder contains starter code and a GIF that shows what the end product should look like:

- [Accordion Animation](./accordion-animation)
- [Loader Animation](./loader-animation)
- [Transition Animation](./transition-button-animation)
- [Spinning Wheel Animation](./spinning-wheel-animation)
- [Clock Animation](./clock-animation)
