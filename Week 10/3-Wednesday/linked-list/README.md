## Introduction

> **Instructor Note**: This lab should be completed in pairs.

In this lab, you'll be creating a simple `LinkedList`. After the basics of the list are done, you'll create a "school" filled with students.

Use your `LinkedList` and `java.util.ArrayList` to complete the tasks in the commented sample code.

## Exercise

### Requirements

- Complete the `MyLinkedList.java` file (excluding the `Iterator`).
- Complete the `Driver.java` file.
- Correctly determine when to use a `LinkedList` or an `ArrayList`.

**Bonus:**

- Complete the `Iterator`.

### Starter Code

In the `starter-code` folder, you'll find a `Node` class and the beginnings of a `LinkedList`. You'll also find a `Driver` class containing instructions for how to interact with students in the school.

**Refer to the solution code for `MyLinkedList.java` if you get stuck.**

### Deliverable

A simple Java program that completes the instructions in the `Driver.java` file.
