## Exercise

This activity will help you review recursion â€” an important concept in many algorithms. As a refresher, recursion has two key elements:

1. The **recursive call** (calling a method from within itself).
2. The **base case** (the check for a condition to stop the recursive calls).

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4MSwiqfLaY) to gain more insight on recursion. Make sure you pay special attention to the explanation on how factorial works. However, you can ignore the section on binary trees. Once you're done watching the video, open the starter code and complete the methods in `Recursion.java`.

If you're having trouble getting started on a specific problem, remember to begin with the base case and then work your way up.

#### Requirements

- Write code for all three recursion problems.

**Bonus:**

- Write code for the bonus recursion problem.

#### Starter Code

[This file](./recursion-practice-starter-code) contains empty methods you need to complete using recursion.

#### Deliverable

A completed `Recursion.java` file that solves all of the recursion problems.
